OKAY!
Let's start.

Chapter 2. - 

1.How to create blocks?

1.1.Create 16x16 sprite (all block sprites are in spr_tilesets.psd file).
1.2.After you paint new block in this file go to -> sprite editor in inspector of this file (check if: Texture Type is: 2d and UI + sprite mode is: Multiple)
1.3.Mark 16x16 block that you painted and name it "Your Name of Block" -> Then Apply
1.4.Check if max size is 128 because this is a size of our .PSD file. -> Then Apply

OKAY we have a block. Now lets move to scripting

5. Where the map saves and everything about maps:

Youtube: Soon
Text: The main map is in Assets folder. 
Map in Assets=>Maps is the first map that will show after click "Start Game"
To add the map to your game:
5.1 Build Game
5.2 Open Game and Start Game
5.3 Close Game
5.4 Find created "Maps" folder in Built Game and replace them by your own Map
5.5 That's all

If you won't have MAPS folder with your own map, it should generate infinite flat map instead.

6. RESOURCES FOLDER

- In resources folder you can find the most important things of the new system of the game:
-there you put: textures of blocks to game 


THAT'S ALL! ;)

Now you can create every block and make it pickable exactly same way! ;)

Just look at the player prefab to understand how it works. It uses sprites as an animation and animator to make it walk and stay.



Thank you for buying this project. I hope that you like the game and you have learned from it.
