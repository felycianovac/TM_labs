 - In the heart of the bustling city stands the Technical University of Moldova (TUM), a beacon of innovation and learning. Among its many faculties, the Faculty of Computers, Informatics, and Microelectronics is known for its brilliant minds and groundbreaking research. But today, the hallowed halls of TUM are awash with unease and whispers of concern.

It was a morning like any other when the news broke out, spreading through the corridors like wildfire. Prof. Bostan, the esteemed Rector of TUM, had vanished without a trace. Known for his charismatic leadership and pivotal role in advancing the university's prestige, Bostan's disappearance has left a void that the rumbling thunder of chaos eagerly seeks to fill.

Rumors swirl amidst the faculty and students, each more outlandish than the last. Some speak of a bitter academic rivalry gone too far, others of a conspiracy that snakes through the very foundations of the university. But amidst the speculation, a deeper shadow looms, hinting at secrets buried within the ivy-clad walls of TUM.

As the sun dips below the horizon, casting long shadows across the campus, four individuals stand at the precipice of an investigation that will unravel the threads of mystery surrounding Bostan's disappearance. Each holds a unique connection to TUM, driven by motives both personal and profound.

For a small group of students, members of a guild called FAF, Bostan is much more than just Rector of TUM, he is more of a Saint to them. While other students were cheering the chaos unleashed on the TUM, for our gang his disappearance brought only sadness and sorrow. 🙁
